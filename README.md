# TimeseriesLSTM
Ballast treament system, data collected from sensors on board ship. LSTM model predicts fail points of system. 

There are several, models attempting to forecast failure of operation of the treament system. One such model I contributed in working in is the LSTM neural network model. Feature engineering was applied, and the input data set, was normalized. 
The data is unfortunately private, and is no longer accessible.
